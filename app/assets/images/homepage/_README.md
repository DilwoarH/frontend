# Guide to optimising images for the homepage

Images can cause a significant increase in the download time for the homepage. To prevent this:

 - resize the image to 600 by 400 pixels. This is the largest that the image will be displayed at.
 - run it through an optimiser, such as `mozjpeg`.

 [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) allows you to do both of these things in the browser. You can play with the settings until you get a good result, comparing the optimised image against the original image.
